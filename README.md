# LevelCrossingAnalysis
Level Crossing Analysis is a powerful statistical method for signal analysis. Here I have used this method in order to analysis the surface roughness of my samples in a quantitative manner 
The input data will be created from surface profile images taken with Zygo microscopy which is a one column data representing the height of the surface profile
The output will be number showing the total upcrossing number for all levels (LC number) and a figure which visualize the results
